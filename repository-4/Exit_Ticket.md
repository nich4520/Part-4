Hello Dr. Graham,

First off I want to thank you for teaching such a great class. I have learned alot and the way the course was presented definetly had a huge impact on that.

When I started this course I didn't know how it was going to go or how well I was going to do at it. I have never done work like this before and that was scary but exciting for me. If I could show the me at the start of the course the part 4 project that I created, I would have never believed it. Thats not to say I didn't have my struggles along the way. It was a tough course because I was a DH beginner. When looking for help in the discord or online, I didn't understand most of the terms being said, which made it hard to find the exact help I even needed. In the readings, I would have to sometimes reread articles to understand what the writer was saying. An example of this was Matthew Lincon's "Confabulation in the Humanitites" article. I was very confused when he started retelling the same story until i realized why he was. THat is was made the learning so great though, when I did get it, everything was eye opening as it was something I was hearing about or seeing for the first time. 

Looking back, my favourite things I learned about were the google my maps and the storymaps. I have always found that maps help me follow along with things alot better (the map of the shire in the lord of the rings jumps out at me as an amazing example of this). When learning these tools, I thought they were amazing and that they were something that I would find lots of use for outside of this class. In the Part 4 exercise, it was definelty the first thing that came to my mind to do when I was looking at the database for patents in Canada. 

After taking this course I have realized how cool and important Digital History is. It has made me look back at history classes back in high school and how the majority of what I learned there was from what was documented by people that could write at the time. We all know that these were a majority of white males which in most cases, has put a certain perspective on history. When Europeans discovered America, they wrote about themselves as explorers and settelers. When if you looked at the other side, natives probably thought of them as invaders, taking away their land. I am not taking any side but instead realizing that the saying "there is more than one side to every story" has alot more meaning than I originally thought. History as a whole has alot of gaps in it and Digital History is a way to help fill some of those gaps.

I just want to end by thanking you again for teaching this course and how well you do it. I really enjoyed the material and would recommend anyone to take this course.
